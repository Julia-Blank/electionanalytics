<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back to the blog! While I’ve spent the past 9 weeks focusing on how to predict elections and analyze forecasts, this week we’ve decided to culminate our studies with a case study: Pennsylvania District 8. Since analyzing numbers and regressions in the abstract oftentimes feels so removed from having consequence on anything meaningful in our political system, I’m hoping to contextualize our work.</p>
<p><strong>DISTRICT OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania District 8 lies in the North Eastern section of the state. It’s comprised of parts of 5 counties: Lackawanna County, Monroe County, Luzerne County, Pike County, and Wayne County. Notably in the 2020 redistricting, parts of Monroe county were added to the district causing a reduction of the Republican lean of the district. The district contains 713,086 people with 78% of them White, 6.5% Black, 2% Asian, and is ethnically 12.8% Hispanic. With a median household income of $56,739 and a college graduation rate of 25.2%, Pennsylvania 8 seems to be a mostly white, working class district. Additionally, 6.9% of the population in the district are veterans (10% higher than Pennsylvania and US average) with an outsized portion of them being those who fought in Vietnam.</p>
<p>In terms of it’s partisanship, Pennsylvania District 8 is one of the infamous “Pivot Counties”. These are counties that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but shifted to vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Additionally, in 2020 this county also voted for Trump while putting in a Democratic Representative in the House. Taking a look at Pennsylvania District 8’s electoral history, the district appears to be a continual toss-up for the House in recent years and since 2016 has entered a unique phase of its electoral makeup. From 2006-2010 they had Democratic Representative, and then from 2010-2018 had a republican representative. In 2018, Democrat Matt Cartwright was elected and has remained as the House Representative since.</p>
<p>Going into the 2022 election, the district seemed to have a Republican partisan lean on the whole. According to the Cook PVI, the district’s rating was Republican +4 signifying in the past two presidential elections the district voted four points more republican than the nation’s average. The Cook PVI wasn’t the only source to categorize the district as Republican leaning with Sabbato’s Crystal Ball also categorizing Pennsylvania 8 as “Leans Republican.” Oddly enough, while the district has had a Republican lean in Presidential elections since 2016, the district has continued to vote for Democratic Representative Matt Cartwright. In fact, it is one of only 13 district that voted for Trump in 2020 and chose a Democrat to represent them.</p>

<p><strong>THE CANDIDATES</strong>
The 2022 general election for the House of Representative’s in Pennsylvania District 8 was between Democratic Incumbent Matt Cartwright and Republican Challenger Jim Bognet. The 2022 general election was in fact a rematch of the 2020 election between these same two candidates. As such, in the Republican primary, Jim Bognet, the Trump-backed candidate, defeated Mike Marsciano with ease and a 37.4 point lead.</p>
<p>To dive in a little deeper, Representative Matt Cartwright is a Democrat who’s served in the House since election in 2012. He originally served in Pennsylvania’s 17th district until 2019 but then was redistricted to the 8th district in 2020. Cartwright received his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and served as a lawyer for 25 years before going into public service. In 2012, he ran his first campaign to win a term in the House of Representatives. Since 2013, Cartwright is seen as a very moderate Democrat and has a reputation for working on bipartisan legislation. He’s served on the House Appropriations Committee and has introduced more bills with Democratic and Republican sepport than any other House Democrat since he was elected.</p>
<p>His challenger, Republican Jim Bognet has worked around government for a while. After receiving a J.D. and M.B.A. from UCLA, he founded a political and business consulting firm. In 2017, Bognet was appointed as a senior policy advisor to the Trump Administration to focus on small buisness support strategies and stimulating American jobs. Bognet got the Trump endorsement during the primary and during the election posed himself as a conservative who is staunchly against the status quo of the Biden administration and Cartwright.</p>
<p>With the background picture painted, it is clear that Pennsylvania’s District 8 was a contentious house election where predominantly white, rural voters were presented the choice between two candidates for the second time: Cartwright, the bipartisan Democrat of the status quo, or Bognet, a Trump Republican protesting against the actions of the Biden administration.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>Historically, people have said that Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the country and fascinatingly enough I’d contend that this district serves as a microcosm of Pennsylvania. Much like the over-arching national narrative of the midterms, this election was between moderate, incumbent Democrat Cartwright and a Republican challenger lamenting the status quo of Biden’s Administration and poor economic conditions.</p>
<p>In terms of economics, incumbent Cartwright had a significantly larger budget for his campaign than challenger Bognet. According to retrospective <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/11/spend-big-win-big-96-of-u-s-house-races-won-by-the-biggest-spender/">analysis done by OpenSecrets</a>, 96% of House races in 2022 were won by the biggest spender, showing some correlation between budget and electoral success. In PA-08, Cartwright raised $4,942,885.51 and spent a little over 4.7 million. Meanwhile, Bognet only raised $2,464,603.32 and spent around 2.1 million (this data is only available from the SEC of 10/19).</p>
<p>Looking at messaging through the framework of Vavreck’s, Jim Bognet, as the challenger, utilized a clarifying campaign and focused on the economy more than any other issue. Specifically, Bognet aimed to tie not just Biden to the economy but his opponent and long-time incumbent Matt Cartwright to both Biden and the economy as well. In his about me page, Bognet utilizes the phrase “Biden-Cartwright agenda” multiple times, inextricably linking the two’s actions. Additionally, he harps on “the economic hardships brought about by the Biden-Cartwright agenda” and discusses his hopes to reduce spending, help businesses, and stimulate key elements of the Pennsylvania economy like energy production. Among the top 3 issues featured on Bognet’s site were “creating good jobs” and stopping the “tax and spending avalanche”. While running</p>
