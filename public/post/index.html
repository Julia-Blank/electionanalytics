            Hi everyone! We’re back this week with another set of models this time exploring the important concept of turnout. This week through building models using a measure of turnout, I’ve set out to investigate: How much does voter turnout actually explain election outcomes on average and does turnout benefit one party over another?
To begin looking at the relationship between party vote share and turnout, I graphed regressions of both the republican or democrat party vote share on turnout.

            Hi everyone! Welcome back to this weeks election analytics blog post. While last week we were looking at the effect of expert prediction and polls, this week I am turning our attentions to the efficacy of air campaigns and it’s role in predicting election outcomes.
Political campaigns are extraordinary operations with thousands of people working and volunteering each year. People dedicate their lives to running and studying these campaigns. With all this attention focused on persuading others and turning out support, the question becomes: How much does the adveretising element of campaigns matter?

            Hi everyone! Welcome back to my election analytics blog. While last week we were looking at purely economic factors, this week I am turning our attentions to the power of the poll and it’s role in predicting election outcomes.
Nate Silver crafts Fivethirtyeight’s election prediction in 2022 by creating 3 versions of one model: the lite, classic, and deluxe models. Each version of the model builds upon each other iterratively in complexity.

        <p>
            Hi everyone! Welcome back to my election analytics blog. This week I am looking at pure economic factors and trying to understand the age old question: Does the status of the economy influence the vote share of incumbent party candidates during elections? Scholars have argued for decades about the extent to which candidates are rewarded or penalized for the status quo of the economy during elections. The traditional thesis that has prevailed is that incumbent candidates party vote share increases when the economy is doing well but decreases when the economy is doing badly.

            Hi everyone! Welcome to the wild world that will be my Election Analytics blog. Before we get into the nitty gritty, allow me to introduce myself. I’m Julia Blank, a junior at Harvard College studying Government on the Data Science Track with a secondary in Computer Science. In my free time, you can find me writing for Harvard Sports Analytics, dancing with the Harvard Dance Team, or as I sit right now, hunkered down in the basement of CGIS south pondering the niche questions of this midterm election.
